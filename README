About EsoRex
-------------

This is version 3.13.5 of the EsoRex application in a form of shared library
mean to be used programatically by C/C++ applications by exposing the main
function as:

  er_main(int argc, char *argv[]).

No headers are provided, c/c++ applications need to resolve the er_main symbol
at linkage time by using extern, e.g.: 

  extern er_main(int argc, char *argv[]);
  
This function works exactly as any main c/c++ function, hence it can handle all
the options originally defined at command line for the original esorex.

Refer to the original version in https://www.eso.org/sci/software/cpl/download.html

Check the README.original file for the original README that comes with EsoRex.

Autoconf
-------------

Few autoconf files were modified, in order to reflect those changes it is needed
to re-generate those files, e.g.:

  autoreconf --install --force
  
Build
-------------

This repository was already configured to to just execute ./configure command,
there is no need to re-generate the autoconf files.

To build the binaries, more about on non-trivial automake options, refer to the
original README (bear in mind that there is external dependencies needed, like
cpl, cfitsio, etc..).

  ./configure \
    --prefix=<where-esorex-will-be-installed> \
  	--with-cpl=<where-cpl-is-installed> \
  	--with-cfitsio=<where-cfitsio-is-installed>
  
Build for VLT2020
-------------

VLT2020 environments, use the cpl and ctext version already provided in VLT2020:

  ./configure --with-cpl=/vlt/VLT2020/cpl --with-cext=/vlt/VLT2020/cpl

As needed:

    make && make install
    
Others
-------------

To clean dist, maintenance, etc:

  MAINTAINER_MODE=1 make maintainer-clean
  make distclean clean
  
Files installed after a build are:

  lib/libesorex.so.0.0.0
  lib/libesorex.so.0
  lib/libesorex.so
  lib/libesorex.la
