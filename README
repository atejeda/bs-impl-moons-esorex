About EsoRex
-------------

This is version 3.13.5 of the EsoRex application if a form of shared library
mean to be used programatically by C/C++ applications by exposing the main
function as:

  er_main(int argc, char *argv[]).

No headers are provided, c/c++ applications need to resolve the er_main symbol
and linkage time by using extern, e.g.: 

  extern er_main(int argc, char *argv[]);

Refer to the original version in https://www.eso.org/sci/software/cpl/download.html

Check the README.original file for the original README that comes with EsoRex.

Autoconf
-------------

Few autoconf files were modified, in order to reflect those changes it is needed
to re-generate those files, e.g.:

  autoreconf --install --force

To clean dist, maintenance, etc:

  MAINTAINER_MODE=1 make maintainer-clean
  make distclean clean

To build the binaries, more about on non-trivial automake options, refer to the
original README.

    --prefix=<where-esorex-will-be-installed> \
  	--with-cpl=<where-cpl-is-installed> \
  	--with-cfitsio=<where-cfitsio-is-installed>
